SAY    \Please select storybook file to load by clicking on the menu button
	- the button in the upper right corner which reads "options" - then
	select the "Play Story" option. A file	selector will open, listing
	all files ending by ".txt": to play one of those, click it.
	Should you be downloading stories in the future, you could keep 'em
	in this folder, for comfortable selection throught the same menu...\

	Should you be willing to learn how to write a storybook, please see
	"How to use The Narrator.txt": the file explains the basics of this
	Interactive Fiction interpreter. The syntax has been designed to be
	as similar as possible to plain english, at least in my intentions.

	Below the bar you see a small crescent: it is the user input prompt
	cursor. By typing there, and if the story has been told to react to
	your particular sentence, you may advance in the game.
	Try typing "hello narrator" there for an example: this sample story
	file, embedded inside The Narrator executable file itself, has been
	told to react to it...
